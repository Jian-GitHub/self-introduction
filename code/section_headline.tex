{\textbf{Bio.}} 
I am currently a third-year student in the School of Information Science and Technology, Hainan Normal University, China.
%I am currently a 4th-year PhD Student at College of ISEE, Zhejiang University, China, 
 %working with Chunguang Li on Variational Bayesian Algorithms and their applications in Distributed Systems. 

{\textbf{Research interests.}} 
I am interested in many technologies. My undergraduate study covered many aspects, such as: \textbf{writing a software in Java,  building a server, writing a website in HTML, and using Manim (3blue1brown's Python animation engine for explanatory math videos)  Create videos, etc}. 
Currently, I am interesting in AI (machine learning, computer vision, and Autonomous-and-Creative Machines) and software architecture (Spring Boot, Vue).
%My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues: \textbf{variational Bayesian inference, 
%stochastic/distributed optimization, probabilistic graphical models, transfer learning, multitask learning 
%and sensor networks}. Currently, I am interesting in varies approaches to deep learning (CNN, GAN, Deep Bayesian Learning, etc.) 
%and their applications to computer vision (image processing, video analysis, etc.).
